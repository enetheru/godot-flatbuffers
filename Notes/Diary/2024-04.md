Having to write notes for myself because otherwise I get lost.

There are three main outputs

editor
template

There are tags like template_release and template_debug but there is no
equivalent tag for editor_debug, so I think simply using the tags separately
will go further for me.

So I can create build configurations that target the template, and the editor
parts separately.

But, there is a bit of a rub in that some options are mutually exclusive for
some reason.

if editor aka TOOLS_ENABLED is mutually esclusive with template.
because template isnt a define, it's the absense of a define.

debug is separate.

we can create four version for use

release
	editor
	template
debug
	editor
	template
