I guess I have been doing this for a week, as my last entry was in April.

I want to write down the perhaps most confusing part of this whole flatbuffer
definition and thats how to get to the locations of the sub obejcts.

I will use
_pos to denote the absolute offset from the start of the file.
_offset for relative positioning
voffset to denote the virtual table offset
toffset to denote the offset relative to the start of the table

like root_pos which is the absolute position of the root table from the start
of the file.

voffset = is known and fixed, determned by schema field order.

toffset = decode_s16(table_pos - vtable_offset + voffset)

field_pos = root_table_pos + toffset + decode_u32( root_table_pos + toffset )

I'm a little tired today from lack of sleep, so cant focus on whether this is
correct and now want to move on to continuing to generate the accessor struct.

OK so now my motivation is flagging for some reason, which means I need to
figure out the blocking reasons and overcome them.

The next field to decode is the accessor in a table for a struct.

OK brain doing what brain does: figuring out how to perhaps re-structure the
project to make sense.

I am about to integrate the information I have back into  the main, Only union
types still exist to generate code for.

What next?

I need to re-work the gdextension so that I can remove the GD_FlatBuffer class
and use FlatBuffer instead.

Also implement the helper functions in terms of c++ to remove the GD_Flatbuffer
thing altogether.

Might be possible to have an alternative implementation built entirely within
gdscript, but I prefer using an extension.

I need to create c++ flatbuffers for the basic types in godot like Vector3 etc.

I also want a test corpus, and a pretty printing function.

it would be nice to be able to generate bfbs for types, and have them displayed
in godot somehow.

I also need tools within godot to generate the flatbuffer classes from fbs
files.

OK it's a bit much, I keep running into feature creep.

I need to figure out how to read these union types. I think I might need to
have a test framework already. Otherwise how am I to know if my auto generated
code can actually read the things..

SO I think that is next.

I can have an editor script that I can run on demand easily enough, but there
is no pleasant button to do it, and relies on menus.

Would be nice to have a button.

It would also be really useful to have an editor plugin base that I can extend
with interesting things.

So many side projects.

Definitely needed to close the loop on this generated code, I'm getting junk in
return.

OK I have a testing script which prints out information about the bfbs, whats
next?

I do need to figure out union types, and I need some form of test corpus, and
then I also need to figure out a way to write to flatbuffers.

I think perhaps I should try to read up on writing a little.

Well that didnt happen, but I did do some work on the gdextension and started
pulling in the gdscript classes I was using, only one function remaining, but
it ties to another class which I'm thinking of rolling into the main.

There are really only a couple of methods, and an extra variable or two.

How about I see if I can make that work.

OK I have some pretty dramatic changes that I need to make to the api, and it's
done in both the flatbuffer project and the godot-flatbuffer gdextension.

Basically I need to replace all the decode functions.. I simply don't need the
translation. which reduces complexity a bunch, but it also causes a lot of
change.

To get the decode func for an array, I need to encode the type into the array
somehow.

I might still be able to use a callable on the bytes.

I need the callable still, but just not for known types.

I guess I need to start breaking things.

But I need to commit my changes before I start hacking away at it.
