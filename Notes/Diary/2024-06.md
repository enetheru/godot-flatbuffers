I've spend the last two weeks or so figuring out how to make a parser, and
doing a bad job at it, I think I have three re-writes for the current state and
I am really unhappy with the result.

I think in the future it would be better to write it in c++ and try to get the
AST from the flatbuffers internal parser if I can, not sure if I can get some
hook for where in the file the lines of code happen though.

I might also want to look at how the existin parsers are built, how other
syntax highlighters work, etc.. I was basically trying to parse the thing, I
could end up building based off it.. nvm it works badly but it works for now.

I have to move onto other things.
