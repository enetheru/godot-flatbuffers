So today I have been trying to sort out the difficulty of the cmake build script, and its been a slow process of re-jugging what I have and taking out all the cruft from the basics.

I have discovered that its possible to change the default build types to something resembling normal.
However, that appears to be relied upon for others things.

The build presets can do interesting things, but not everything.

Inside a configurePreset;
```json
"environment": {  
    "CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES": "Editor;EditorDev;Template;TemplateDebug",  
    "CMAKE_DEFAULT_BUILD_TYPE": "Editor",  
    "CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL ": "12"  
},
```

But instead I am going to use the defaults, and simply re-interpret their meaning.
* Debug = Editor
* Release = Template
* RelWithDebInfo = Template_Debug

And for editor with dev build info, I will just add another flag for that.

GODDAMN, the woeful setup of the cmake project in the gdextension brings me to tears. I have spent the whole day looking at this shit.
